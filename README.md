# PCA-Face-Recognition
This Jupyter Notebook applies PCA for image compression and facial recognition. It preprocesses images, performs dimensionality reduction, reconstructs images, and compares similarity using SSIM and MSE. It also generates synthetic faces and finds the closest match to a given image.
